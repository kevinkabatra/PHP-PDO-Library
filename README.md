# PHP-PDO-Library

Library for dynamic use of PHP Data Objects (PDO). 

This project continues my earlier work on dynamic PDO based systems (@Deprecated: https://github.com/kevinkabatra/Dynamic-PHP-PDO). This library will be great for new projects, especially for those who are new to PDO and MySql, as the code allows for rapid deployment without any need of additional boiler plate. Every function within the library is documented with explanations of the function, and even includes code examples on how to interact with the function. The library currently supports the follwing features:

MySql:
    
    1) New PDO connection to database
    2) Check if table exists
    3) Check if database exists
    4) Create table
    5) Insert record(s) into database
    6) Delete record(s) from database
    7) Select record(s) from database
    8) Update record(s) within database


Future plans: adding support for other MySQL functions, adding support for other database systems.

Warm Regards,

Kevin Kabatra
